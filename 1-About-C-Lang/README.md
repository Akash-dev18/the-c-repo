when ever you write gcc file.c, 2 things happen
- Compilation : file.c -> file.o 
	- you can manually do that by `gcc -c file.c`, it will generea a file.o (Object file), which is machine code
- Linking : file.o -> a.out
	- all the object files are then linked together to form a binary file that is executable
